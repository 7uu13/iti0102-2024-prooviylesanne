## EX1 - network_connections_solution

### Rebranded version of a problem that was given to us in the first KT. (KT1 - iti0102-2023)
    You're given a log of network connection chains between devices. 

    Each connection chain consists of one device connecting to another, which then connects to yet another device, forming a sequence. 
    Your task is to parse this log and extract the network connection patterns among these devices.

    Write a function parse_network_connections that takes in a string representing the network connection log and returns a dictionary 
    where each key is a device's name and the corresponding value is a list of devices it has connected to.

    Each device name should appear only once in the list, and the order of devices in the lists or keys in the dictionary is not important.

## EX2 - swap_dict_keys_and_value_lists

### No changes has been done to this one. (1:1 problem from KT3 - iti0102-2023)

    Swap keys and values in dict.

    Values are lists.
    Every element in this list should be a key,
    and current key will be a value for the new key.
    Values in the result are lists.

    Every list in input dict has at least 1 element.
    The order of the values in the result dict is not important.
